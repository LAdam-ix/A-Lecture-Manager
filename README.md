A final projent for PV178 - "Úvod do vývoje v C# or .NET"

## DEBUG - for tutor's testing
To Activate DUMMY mode set DUMMY inside EncodeManager to true and manualy change the Inicialized in EncoderManager. Also all code with dummy would not normally be in and is only for testing.
Dummy mode is kinda broken when you do resume(from db), because normaly it will take fresh data so it always resets, but with dummy they are not resetting. Also, the data aren't accurate (for example, it will finished before the whole bar is full ...)
