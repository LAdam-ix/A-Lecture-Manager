# A-Lecture-Manager
To Activate DUMMY mode set DUMMY inside EncodeManager to true and manualy change the Inicialized in EncoderManager. Also all code with dummy would not normally be in and is only for testing.
Dummy mode is kinda broken when you do resume(from db), because normaly it will take fress data so it always reset, but with dummy they are not reseting. Also the data aren't accurite (for example, it will finished before the whole bar is full ...)
